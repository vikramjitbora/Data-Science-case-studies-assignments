# Data-Science-case-studies-assignments
Portfolio of data science projects completed as part of academic requirements of PGDDS, IIIT Bangalore


## Contents

- [Credit Risk Analysis EDA](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20EDA/Credit%20EDA.ipynb): Analysis of loan dataset and performing Exploratory Data Analysis on it to develop understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how the data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.



- [Bike Sharing Prediction](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Bike%20Sharing%20Prediction/Bike_Sharing.ipynb): Build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 


- [Advanced Regression Assignment](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Advanced%20Regression%20Assignment/House%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb): Build a regresion model to predict the price of houses in the Australian market. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.


- [Lead Scoring Case Study](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Lead%20Scoring%20Case%20Study/Lead%20Scoring.ipynb): Analysis of a leads dataset to improve the lead conversion rate for an online education company. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. The model is also able to adapt to changing requirements of the company. 


- [Customer Churn Case Study](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Customer%20Churn%20Case%20Study/telecom_churn_case_study.ipynb):  Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of a customer churn at the last month based on the data from previous months. Also, understand the customer behaviour during churn and recommend strategies to manage customer churn

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/vikramjitbora/Data-Science-case-studies-assignments/blob/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb): Build a fraud detection model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Also, handled the data imbalance using appropriate techniques such as Oversampling, SMOTE or Adasyn. Build logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost models on both unbalanced data as well as balanced data.
